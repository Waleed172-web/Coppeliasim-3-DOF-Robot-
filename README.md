# Coppeliasim-3-DOF-Robot-
This project uses a 3-DOF robot to practice Modern Robotics basics. I am using this simulation to test Forward Kinematics (FK), Inverse Kinematics (IK), and robot dynamics. Even though the robot design is simple, it is a great starting point for turning mathematical theories into a working simulation.
